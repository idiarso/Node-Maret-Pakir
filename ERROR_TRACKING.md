# Error Tracking from Commit 1a14b0cd6e

## Initial Issues Found

1. **Auth Middleware Path Inconsistency**
   - Files were importing from both `auth.middleware` and `auth`
   - Some files had incorrect import paths
   - Affected files:
     - auth.routes.ts
     - device.routes.ts
     - parkingArea.routes.ts
     - ticket.routes.ts
     - user.routes.ts
     - dashboard.routes.ts
     - gate.routes.ts
     - backup.routes.ts

2. **Controller Instance Creation Inconsistency**
   - Some controllers using singleton pattern (getInstance)
   - Others using direct instantiation (new Controller())
   - Affected controllers:
     - TicketController
     - DeviceController
     - GateController
     - ParkingAreaController
     - UserController
     - DashboardController

3. **Entity Relationship Issues**
   - Device and DeviceHealthCheck relationship not properly configured
   - Missing entity registrations in TypeORM config
   - Database configuration spread across multiple files

## Fixes Applied

1. **Auth Middleware Standardization**
   ```typescript
   // Changed all imports to use consistent path
   import { authMiddleware } from '../middleware/auth.middleware';
   ```

2. **Controller Instantiation Standardization**
   - For singleton controllers:
   ```typescript
   const controller = Controller.getInstance();
   ```
   - For regular controllers:
   ```typescript
   const controller = new Controller();
   ```

3. **Database Configuration Consolidation**
   - Consolidated entity registration in `database.ts`
   - Added proper entity relationships
   - Fixed entity metadata issues

## Current Status

1. **Working:**
   - Auth middleware imports are consistent
   - Database configuration is consolidated
   - Entity relationships are properly defined

2. **Still Needs Attention:**
   - Controller instantiation pattern needs to be standardized
   - Some route handlers may need method name corrections
   - TypeORM entity metadata warnings need investigation

## Root Cause Analysis

The issues stemmed from:
1. Inconsistent code patterns across the codebase
2. Multiple developers using different approaches
3. Lack of standardized architecture decisions
4. Mixed usage of singleton and non-singleton patterns

## Recommendations

1. **Standardize Controller Pattern**
   - Either use singleton pattern consistently
   - Or use dependency injection with regular instantiation

2. **Code Organization**
   - Keep all database config in one place
   - Standardize middleware imports
   - Document architectural decisions

3. **Testing**
   - Add integration tests for routes
   - Add unit tests for controllers
   - Test entity relationships

## Next Steps

1. Choose and implement consistent controller pattern
2. Update remaining route files to match chosen pattern
3. Add proper error handling and logging
4. Create documentation for code standards
5. Implement automated tests
